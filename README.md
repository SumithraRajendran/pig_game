# Pig Game Project

Welcome to the README for the Pig Game project. This project involves creating a simple and entertaining dice game where players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points. The goal is to reach a predefined score before your opponent does.

## Rules

- Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
- On each turn, a player can roll the die as many times as they like and add up the results.
- If a player rolls a 1, their current turn's score is reset to zero, and the turn shifts to the other player.
- A player can choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn, which adds their current turn's score to their total score.
- The first player to reach a predefined score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
